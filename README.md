# Tai
[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/fremantle-capital/tai.png)](https://circleci.com/gh/fremantle-capital/tai)

A trading toolkit built with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and running on the [Erlang virtual machine](http://erlang.org/faq/implementations.html)

## WARNING

`tai` is alpha quality software. It passes our test suite but the API is highly 
likely to change and no effort will be made to maintain backwards compatibility.
We are working to make `tai` production quality software.

## Installation

Tai requires Elixir 1.6. Add `tai` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tai, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Or use the bleeding edge from `master`

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tai, github: "fremantle-capital/tai"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

`tai` currently runs as an interactive mix console application. Once started 
it subscribes to the configured live order book feeds, can execute orders and 
process events using a uniform API across exchanges.


```bash
iex -S mix
```

When the interactive console is running it will start the [configured](#configuration) 
order books, [advisors](#advisors) and allow you to manually execute [commands](#commands).

### Commands

#### help

Display the available commands and usage examples

```bash
iex(1)> help
* balance
* markets
* orders
* buy_limit exchange(:gdax), symbol(:btcusd), price(101.12), size(1.2)
* sell_limit exchange(:gdax), symbol(:btcusd), price(101.12), size(1.2)
* order_status exchange(:gdax), order_id("f1bb2fa3-6218-45be-8691-21b98157f25a")
* cancel_order exchange(:gdax), order_id("f1bb2fa3-6218-45be-8691-21b98157f25a")
```

#### markets

Displays the live top of the order book for the configured feeds. It also 
includes the time they were last processed and sent from the server which 
allows you to monitor if the feed is starting to fall behind while updating 
the order books.

```

#### orders

Displays the list of orders and their status.

**[IN PROGRESS:](https://github.com/fremantle-capital/tai/tree/order-feed-spike)**

As the lifecycle of the order changes i.e. partial fills, process events and 
update in the background so that the information is available when you re-run 
the `orders` command.

```
iex(3)> orders
+----------+--------+-----------+-------+------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------+----------------+------------+
| Exchange | Symbol |      Type | Price | Size | Status |                            Client ID | Server ID |    Enqueued At | Created At |
+----------+--------+-----------+-------+------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------+----------------+------------+
|     gdax | btcusd | buy_limit | 100.1 |  0.1 |  error | a6aa15bc-b271-486f-ab40-f9b35b2cd223 |           | 20 minutes ago |            |
+----------+--------+-----------+-------+------+--------+--------------------------------------+-----------+----------------+------------+
```

## Advisors

Run in their own process and receive asynchronous events when the order books change.
They are intended to be run without supervison to analyze data or execute trading strategies.

[Examples](test/support/advisors)

## Debugging

Error, warning and information messages are written to a separate log for each 
environment written to the `logs` directory.

To monitor a stream of logs you can use the `tail` command

```bash
tail -f logs/dev.log
```

If you would like to filter the log messages to target certain patterns or 
processes you can combine it with the `grep` command.

```bash
tail -f logs/dev.log | grep advisor_spread_capture
```

## Configuration

Each environment can have their own configuration. Take a look at the [example 
dev configuration](config/dev.exs.example) for available options.
